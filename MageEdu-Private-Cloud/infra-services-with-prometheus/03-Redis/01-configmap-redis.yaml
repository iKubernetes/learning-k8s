    # Redis configuration file example.
    #
    # Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
    # started with the file path as first argument:
    #
    # ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
    #slaveof redis-master-0.redis-master.redis.svc.cluster.local 6379
    # masterauth a-very-complex-password-here
    # requirepass a-very-complex-password-here
    # Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
    # it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
    #
    # 1k => 1000 bytes
    # 1kb => 1024 bytes
    # 1m => 1000000 bytes
    # 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
    # 1g => 1000000000 bytes
    # 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
    #
    # units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

    # Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
    # have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
    # to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
    # other files, so use this wisely.
    #
    # Notice option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
    # from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
    # line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
    # at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
    #
    # If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
    # options, it is better to use include as the last line.

    # Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules
    # it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.

    # loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so
    ################################## NETWORK #####################################
    # By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
    # for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
    # It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
    # the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
    # bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
    #
    # ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
    # internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
    # instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
    # following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
    # the IPv4 loopback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
    # accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it
    # is running).
    #
    # IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
    # JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    bind 0.0.0.0
    # Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
    # Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
    #
    # When protected mode is on and if:
    #
    # 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
    #    "bind" directive.
    # 2) No password is configured.
    #
    # The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
    # IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
    # sockets.
    #
    # By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
    # you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
    # even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
    # are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.

    #
    # In high requests-per-second environments you need an high backlog in order
    # to avoid slow clients connections issues. Note that the Linux kernel
    # will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so

    #
    # If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
    # of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
    #
    # 1) Detect dead peers.
    # 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
    #    equipment in the middle.
    #
    # On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
    # Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
    # On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
    #
    # A reasonable value for this option is 300 seconds, which is the new
    # Redis default starting with Redis 3.2.1.

    # By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
    # Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
    daemonize no
    # If you run Redis from upstart or systemd, Redis can interact with your
    # supervision tree. Options:
    #   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
    #   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode
    #   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
    #   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
    #                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
    # Note: these supervision methods only signal "process is ready."
    #       They do not enable continuous liveness pings back to your supervisor.

    # If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup
    # and removes it at exit.
    #
    # When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
    # specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
    # is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/var/run/redis.pid".

    # nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.

    # Specify the server verbosity level.
    # This can be one of:

    #   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
    #   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
    #
    #   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:

    #   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
    #   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
    #
    #   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
    #
    #   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
    #   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
    #   like in the following example:
    #
    # #   save ""
    save ""
    # save 900 1
    # save 300 10
    # save 60 10000

    # automatically allow writes again.

    ################################# REPLICATION #################################
    # Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
    # another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
    #
    #   +------------------+      +---------------+
    #   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
    #   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
    #   +------------------+      +---------------+
    #
    # 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
    #    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
    #    a given number of replicas.
    # 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
    #    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
    #    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
    #    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
    # 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
    #    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
    #    and resynchronize with them.
    #
    # replicaof <masterip> <masterport>
    # If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
    # directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
    # starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
    # refuse the replica request.
    #
    #
    # However this is not enough if you are using Redis ACLs (for Redis version
    # 6 or greater), and the default user is not capable of running the PSYNC
    # command and/or other commands needed for replication. In this case it's
    # better to configure a special user to use with replication, and specify the
    # masteruser configuration as such:
    #
    #masteruser master
    #
    # When masteruser is specified, the replica will authenticate against its
    # master using the new AUTH form: AUTH <username> <password>.
    # When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
    # is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
    #
    # 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
    #    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
    #    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
    #
    # 2) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
    #    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
    #    but to INFO, replicaOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG,
    #    SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB,
    #    COMMAND, POST, HOST: and LATENCY.
    #
    replica-serve-stale-data yes
    # You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
    # a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
    # written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
    # may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
    # misconfiguration.
    #
    # Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
    #
    # Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
    # on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
    # Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
    # such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
    # security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
    # administrative / dangerous commands.
    replica-read-only yes
    # Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
    #
    # New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the
    # replication process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a
    # "full synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the
    # replicas.
    #
    # The transmission can happen in two different ways:
    #
    # 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
    #                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
    #                 process to the replicas incrementally.
    # 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
    #              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
    #
    # With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
    # can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child
    # producing the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead
    # once the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new
    # transfer will start when the current one terminates.
    #
    # When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
    # time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple
    # replicas will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
    #
    # With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
    # works better.
    repl-diskless-sync no
    # When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
    # the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
    # to the replicas.
    #
    # This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
    # new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the
    # server waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
    #
    # The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
    # it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # WARNING: RDB diskless load is experimental. Since in this setup the replica
    # does not immediately store an RDB on disk, it may cause data loss during
    # failovers. RDB diskless load + Redis modules not handling I/O reads may also
    # cause Redis to abort in case of I/O errors during the initial synchronization
    # stage with the master. Use only if your do what you are doing.
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Replica can load the RDB it reads from the replication link directly from the
    # socket, or store the RDB to a file and read that file after it was completely
    # recived from the master.
    #
    # In many cases the disk is slower than the network, and storing and loading
    # the RDB file may increase replication time (and even increase the master's
    # Copy on Write memory and salve buffers).
    # However, parsing the RDB file directly from the socket may mean that we have
    # to flush the contents of the current database before the full rdb was
    # received. For this reason we have the following options:
    #
    # "disabled"    - Don't use diskless load (store the rdb file to the disk first)
    # "on-empty-db" - Use diskless load only when it is completely safe.
    # "swapdb"      - Keep a copy of the current db contents in RAM while parsing
    #                 the data directly from the socket. note that this requires
    #                 sufficient memory, if you don't have it, you risk an OOM kill.

    #

    # After a master has no longer connected replicas for some time, the backlog
    # will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
    # need to elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for
    # the backlog buffer to be freed.
    #
    # Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
    # promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
    # resynchronize" with the replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
    #
    # A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
    #
    # repl-backlog-ttl 3600
    # The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO
    # output. It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote
    # into a master if the master is no longer working correctly.
    #
    # A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
    # for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel
    # will pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
    #
    # However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
    # role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
    # Redis Sentinel for promotion.
    #
    # By default the priority is 100.
    replica-priority 100
    # It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
    # N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
    #
    # The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
    #
    # The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
    # the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
    #
    # This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
    # will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
    # are available, to the specified number of seconds.
    #
    # For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
    #
    # min-replicas-to-write 3
    # min-replicas-max-lag 10
    #
    # Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
    #
    # By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
    # min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.
    # A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
    # replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
    # offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
    # Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
    # Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
    # "ROLE" command of a master.
    #
    # The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
    # in the following way:
    #
    #   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
    #   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
    #
    #   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
    #   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
    #   listen for connections.
    #
    # However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
    # used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
    # pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
    # report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
    # and ROLE will report those values.
    #
    # There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
    # the port or the IP address.

    ############################### KEYS TRACKING #################################
    # Redis implements server assisted support for client side caching of values.
    # This is implemented using an invalidation table that remembers, using
    # 16 millions of slots, what clients may have certain subsets of keys. In turn
    # this is used in order to send invalidation messages to clients. Please
    # to understand more about the feature check this page:
    #
    #   https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
    #
    # When tracking is enabled for a client, all the read only queries are assumed
    # to be cached: this will force Redis to store information in the invalidation
    # table. When keys are modified, such information is flushed away, and
    # invalidation messages are sent to the clients. However if the workload is
    # heavily dominated by reads, Redis could use more and more memory in order
    # to track the keys fetched by many clients.
    #
    # For this reason it is possible to configure a maximum fill value for the
    # invalidation table. By default it is set to 1M of keys, and once this limit
    # is reached, Redis will start to evict keys in the invalidation table
    # even if they were not modified, just to reclaim memory: this will in turn
    # force the clients to invalidate the cached values. Basically the table
    # maximum size is a trade off between the memory you want to spend server
    # side to track information about who cached what, and the ability of clients
    # to retain cached objects in memory.
    #
    # If you set the value to 0, it means there are no limits, and Redis will
    # retain as many keys as needed in the invalidation table.
    # In the "stats" INFO section, you can find information about the number of
    # keys in the invalidation table at every given moment.
    #
    # Note: when key tracking is used in broadcasting mode, no memory is used
    # in the server side so this setting is useless.

    ################################## SECURITY ###################################
    # Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
    # 1 million passwords per second against a modern box. This means that you
    # should use very strong passwords, otherwise they will be very easy to break.
    # Note that because the password is really a shared secret between the client
    # and the server, and should not be memorized by any human, the password
    # can be easily a long string from /dev/urandom or whatever, so by using a
    # long and unguessable password no brute force attack will be possible.
    # Redis ACL users are defined in the following format:
    #
    #   user <username> ... acl rules ...
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99
    #
    # The special username "default" is used for new connections. If this user
    # has the "nopass" rule, then new connections will be immediately authenticated
    # as the "default" user without the need of any password provided via the
    # AUTH command. Otherwise if the "default" user is not flagged with "nopass"
    # the connections will start in not authenticated state, and will require
    # AUTH (or the HELLO command AUTH option) in order to be authenticated and
    # start to work.
    #
    # The ACL rules that describe what an user can do are the following:
    #
    #  on           Enable the user: it is possible to authenticate as this user.
    #  off          Disable the user: it's no longer possible to authenticate
    #               with this user, however the already authenticated connections
    #               will still work.
    #  +<command>   Allow the execution of that command
    #  -<command>   Disallow the execution of that command
    #  +@<category> Allow the execution of all the commands in such category
    #               with valid categories are like @admin, @set, @sortedset, ...
    #               and so forth, see the full list in the server.c file where
    #               the Redis command table is described and defined.
    #               The special category @all means all the commands, but currently
    #               present in the server, and that will be loaded in the future
    #               via modules.
    #  +<command>|subcommand    Allow a specific subcommand of an otherwise
    #                           disabled command. Note that this form is not
    #                           allowed as negative like -DEBUG|SEGFAULT, but
    #                           only additive starting with "+".
    #  allcommands  Alias for +@all. Note that it implies the ability to execute
    #               all the future commands loaded via the modules system.
    #  nocommands   Alias for -@all.
    #  ~<pattern>   Add a pattern of keys that can be mentioned as part of
    #               commands. For instance ~* allows all the keys. The pattern
    #               is a glob-style pattern like the one of KEYS.
    #               It is possible to specify multiple patterns.
    #  allkeys      Alias for ~*
    #  resetkeys    Flush the list of allowed keys patterns.
    #  ><password>  Add this passowrd to the list of valid password for the user.
    #               For example >mypass will add "mypass" to the list.
    #               This directive clears the "nopass" flag (see later).
    #  <<password>  Remove this password from the list of valid passwords.
    #  nopass       All the set passwords of the user are removed, and the user
    #               is flagged as requiring no password: it means that every
    #               password will work against this user. If this directive is
    #               used for the default user, every new connection will be
    #               immediately authenticated with the default user without
    #               any explicit AUTH command required. Note that the "resetpass"
    #               directive will clear this condition.
    #  resetpass    Flush the list of allowed passwords. Moreover removes the
    #               "nopass" status. After "resetpass" the user has no associated
    #               passwords and there is no way to authenticate without adding
    #               some password (or setting it as "nopass" later).
    #  reset        Performs the following actions: resetpass, resetkeys, off,
    #               -@all. The user returns to the same state it has immediately
    #               after its creation.
    #
    # ACL rules can be specified in any order: for instance you can start with
    # passwords, then flags, or key patterns. However note that the additive
    # and subtractive rules will CHANGE MEANING depending on the ordering.
    # For instance see the following example:
    #
    #   user alice on +@all -DEBUG ~* >somepassword
    #
    # This will allow "alice" to use all the commands with the exception of the
    # DEBUG command, since +@all added all the commands to the set of the commands
    # alice can use, and later DEBUG was removed. However if we invert the order
    # of two ACL rules the result will be different:
    #
    #   user alice on -DEBUG +@all ~* >somepassword
    #
    # Now DEBUG was removed when alice had yet no commands in the set of allowed
    # commands, later all the commands are added, so the user will be able to
    # execute everything.
    #
    # Basically ACL rules are processed left-to-right.
    #
    # For more information about ACL configuration please refer to
    # the Redis web site at https://redis.io/topics/acl
    # ACL LOG
    #
    # The ACL Log tracks failed commands and authentication events associated
    # with ACLs. The ACL Log is useful to troubleshoot failed commands blocked
    # by ACLs. The ACL Log is stored in memory. You can reclaim memory with
    # ACL LOG RESET. Define the maximum entry length of the ACL Log below.
    acllog-max-len 128
    # Using an external ACL file
    #
    # Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use
    # a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:
    # if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the exteranl
    # ACL file, the server will refuse to start.
    #
    # The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the
    # format that is used inside redis.conf to describe users.
    #
    # aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl
    # IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6 "requirepass" is just a compatiblity
    # layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
    # the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
    # AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
    # if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
